	<h1>Pratice page</h1>
	<p>While doing my research for a proper history of bread site, I used 4 pre-existing sites:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href = "https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-sliced-bread#:~:text=The%20first%20automatically%20sliced%20commercial,was%20not%20without%20its%20challenges.">"who invented sliced bread"</a></li>
		<li><a href = "https://www.goldmedalbakery.com/blog/when-was-sliced-bread-invented/">"When was sliced bread invented"</a></li>
		<li><a href = "http://www.historyofbread.com/bread-history/history-of-sliced-bread/">"History of Sliced Bread - Modern Baking Industry"</a></li>
		<li><a href = "https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1317263">"Bread-slicing Machine"</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>The first thing I noticed on all these sites is that every single one had a site logo in the top right corner. Some of them were for a bigger site that publishes all sorts of articles (like in history.com), while others were just about bakeries or bread (aka historyofbread.com). I decided to go with the second type of logo. Using a site called canva and came up with this:</p>
	<img id = "standalone" src = "../main/images/dig_hum_site_logo.png">

	<p>The next thing I noticed was that the logo was placed at the left of a navigation bar in every site. Nevermind that I don't actually have any links to put in the naviagation bar, for the sake of this assignment I'll just put empty links.</p>
	<p>Typically, these navigation bars follow a colour scheme and font that is used throughout the website. I decided to use a colour scheme revolving around the colours purple and grey, seeing as those are the colours used in my logo</p>

	<p>Here is my attempt at a navigation bar:</p>
	<p>Hold on I don't know how to get spaces between these elements yet</p>
	<p>Ok, HERE is the navigation bar:</p>

	<nav id = "navbar">
		<div id = "navbarcontainer">
			<a href = ""><img id = "navbarlogo" src = "../main/images/dig_hum_site_logo.png"></a>
			<ul class = "navbarlinks">
				<li><a href="">MORE ARTICLES</a></li>
				<li><a href="">ABOUT</a></li>
				<li><a href="">CONTACT US</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</nav>

	<p>Now that that was figured out, time to go on to the next website feature found in every site: style.</p>
	<p>I've already decided on my colour scheme: purple and grey. It is now time to choose my font.</p>
	<p>Every site has a nice, simple to read font that is easy on the eye. I, personally, think the font I used in the navigation bar (poppins) is quite nice so I will continue to use that.</p>

	<h2>Newly Styled Section</h2>
	<p id = "oof">I will now continue the rest of this page in the next site's style.</p>

	<p id = "oof">Another thing to notice is that every subtitle has a fancy element added to it, whether its being bolded and enlarged, changing colour or having an eye catching line.</p>
	<p id = "oof">My personal favourite is the subtitle style seen in "When was sliced bread invented?". That article has a subtitle with an underline using both colours of its colour scheme. I've decided to do something similar: </p>

	<h2 id = special>This is the new subtitle</h2>

	<p id = "oof">Now that the style has been decided, it is also noticeable that all the sites are filled with links in their paragraphs.</p>
	<p id = "oof">Typically, these links would lead to somewhere else with more information, but seeing as I HAVE no more information, these links are going to have to lead nowhere.</p>
	<p id = "oof">Looking at the styles of all the other websites, these links are usually written in normal text but differently coloured, the link underline only appearing once you hover over it.</p>

	<p id = "oof">So, <a id = "internalLink" href = "">here</a> is my attempt to do the same</p>

	<p id = "oof">Next, they are all filled with photos of their topic: bread</p>
	<p id = "oof">I do not think it is necessary to add them to this page, but I can decide on the style of these photos. Some pages have their photos taking up the entire page width and others have them to the side.</p>
	<p id = "oof">I think I'd like to have my photos on the left side, providing a little break in text as I continue to explain the history of bread.</p>

	<p id = "oof">Finally, it seems like all pages have a footer at the bottom of their pages for more information.</p>
	<p id = "oof">Some are more complex, requiring an entirely new box and list. However, some are quite similar and can get the job done in a simple paragraph. That is the type I will be making</p>

	<p id = "oof">This is approximately what it will look like:</p>

	<p id = "footer">Â© 2022 - Complete History of Bread | <a id = "internalLink" href = "">Privacy Policy</a> | <a id = "internalLink" href = "">Contact us</a></p>
	


	<p id = "oof">That completes all the prepwork for the site. The actual site can be accessed <a id = "internalLink" href = "../main/history_of_bread.html">here</a></p>
